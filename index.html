Most people who have explored their body  soon discover that touching may cause sexual    arousal and pleasurable sensations. When pe-  ople spend time alone touching themselves and    often bringing themselves to orgasm, it is cal-  led"masturbation".</p>     <p> People are enormously inventive, and everyo-  ne has their own way of masturbating. While    some techniques are more common than oth-  ers, every individual has virtually unlimited scope for enjoying masturbation. You can ex-  plore"masturbation" while you are growing up    and continue to do so as an adult to find out  what you like. It’s all about how, where and  when, about pressure and speed, clothing and  objects. You might enjoy constant variety, or  you might find that certain techniques become  particular favourites. This guide contains a few  suggestions on how to masturbate. Needless to  say, there are many more techniques than we  could cover in a small booklet like this.</p>       <h2  > Masturbate throughout life</h2>     <p> The main reason why people masturbate is for    pleasure and arousal. For many people, mas-  turbation plays an important role throughout    their life, regardless of gender, background and    relationship status. Most men and women dis-  cover masturbation at an early age, and it be-  comes a lifelong companion – from childhood,    through their teenage years, into adulthood,  and on into old age. Masturbation is often    people’s first way of approaching and expres-  sing their sexuality, and for some people it is    the only way of enjoying their sexuality at cer-  tain stages or throughout their life. How often you masturbate may vary over time. There are  periods when you want to do it every day, and    others when you don’t want to at all. Masturba-  tion can be a way to relax for a while or to wind    down after a day at school, college or work. By  masturbating, young people can discover their  body, gain experience of sexual pleasure, and  gradually devise new ways to"masturbate".</p>   <p align="justify"> Children"masturbate" too, but this is seldom    talked about. Children’s sexuality, and mastur-  bation in particular, remains a sensitive topic    that many people find it hard to deal with.  It’s important to let children explore their bodies by themselves, at their own pace, without  adults making them feel ashamed.</p>   <p> People masturbate at different times and in  different places. Many people, and perhaps  young people in particular, wonder at some    point in their life whether they are masturba-  ting too much. Some are concerned that mas-  turbating might adversely affect their sex life in    a relationship. Or they might see it as a form of  cheating, where they or their partner feel they  are unattractive or inadequate. Or they might  be jealous of their partner’s secret masturbation  fantasies. Occasionally there may be cause for concern: if masturbation is taking precedence  over everything else, if you’re skipping classes  or work, if you’ve lost interest in sex with your  partner, or if you’re avoiding human contact so  that you can be left to masturbate in peace. But  these situations are unusual and are usually a  sign that something else is amiss in your life. In  such cases, there are people you can turn to for  help, such as counsellors and therapists.</p>     </body>     <footer>     YOURTIDINGS.ORG 2022  </footer>     </html>   © 2022 GitHub, Inc.
