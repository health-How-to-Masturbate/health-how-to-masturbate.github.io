<h1> Masturbate a hands on guide do it yourself sex</h1>   
<h2>Men"s Masturbate / Women"s Masturbate</h2>    
<p> Everyone touches their own body sometimes –  the genitals, the nipples, the anus or other parts.  Most people who have explored their body  soon discover that touching may cause sexual    arousal and pleasurable sensations. When pe-  ople spend time alone touching themselves and    often bringing themselves to orgasm, it is cal-  led"masturbation".</p>     <p> People are enormously inventive, and everyo-  ne has their own way of masturbating. While    some techniques are more common than oth-  ers, every individual has virtually unlimited scope for enjoying masturbation. You can ex-  plore"masturbation" while you are growing up    and continue to do so as an adult to find out  what you like. It’s all about how, where and  when, about pressure and speed, clothing and  objects. You might enjoy constant variety, or  you might find that certain techniques become  particular favourites. This guide contains a few  suggestions on how to masturbate. Needless to  say, there are many more techniques than we  could cover in a small booklet like this.</p>       <h2  > Masturbate throughout life</h2>     <p> The main reason why people masturbate is for    pleasure and arousal. For many people, mas-  turbation plays an important role throughout    their life, regardless of gender, background and    relationship status. Most men and women dis-  cover masturbation at an early age, and it be-  comes a lifelong companion – from childhood,    through their teenage years, into adulthood,  and on into old age. Masturbation is often    people’s first way of approaching and expres-  sing their sexuality, and for some people it is    the only way of enjoying their sexuality at cer-  tain stages or throughout their life. How often you masturbate may vary over time. There are  periods when you want to do it every day, and    others when you don’t want to at all. Masturba-  tion can be a way to relax for a while or to wind    down after a day at school, college or work. By  masturbating, young people can discover their  body, gain experience of sexual pleasure, and  gradually devise new ways to"masturbate".</p>   <p align="justify"> Children"masturbate" too, but this is seldom    talked about. Children’s sexuality, and mastur-  bation in particular, remains a sensitive topic    that many people find it hard to deal with.  It’s important to let children explore their bodies by themselves, at their own pace, without  adults making them feel ashamed.</p>   <p> People masturbate at different times and in  different places. Many people, and perhaps  young people in particular, wonder at some    point in their life whether they are masturba-  ting too much. Some are concerned that mas-  turbating might adversely affect their sex life in    a relationship. Or they might see it as a form of  cheating, where they or their partner feel they  are unattractive or inadequate. Or they might  be jealous of their partner’s secret masturbation  fantasies. Occasionally there may be cause for concern: if masturbation is taking precedence  over everything else, if you’re skipping classes  or work, if you’ve lost interest in sex with your  partner, or if you’re avoiding human contact so  that you can be left to masturbate in peace. But  these situations are unusual and are usually a  sign that something else is amiss in your life. In  such cases, there are people you can turn to for  help, such as counsellors and therapists.</p>   
 <p>Remember that masturbation is usually an
outlet for pleasure, arousal and sexual urges.
It’s a separate form of sexual expression, regapeople. Masturbation may be an expression of
affection for your own body, or it may give you
a sense of freedom, with unlimited scope for
fantasizing and controlling your enjoyment.
There are things you can do while masturbating that you might not be able or want to do
with a partner. Fantasies and a desire for pleasure fuel our sexual urges, and masturbation as
an expression of those urges may in turn pave
the way for new fantasies and knowledge of our
body’s positive reactions. Our imagination gives us control of our sexual urges and the opportunity to create our own pleasure.</p>

<H3>What happens in the body when we "masturbate"?</h3>

<p>Sexual arousal begins when we receive impressions relayed by the senses. The brain then
processes and interprets our thoughts and fantasies, along with the images, sounds, touches,
scents and tastes that help to shape them. The
brain transmits impulses to various parts of the
body, which react accordingly. Lubrication and
erection are examples of such reactions.</p>

<p>The physical reaction, known as the sexual response, is no different whether we are having
sex with a partner or masturbating</p>
<p>Masturbation releases various substances in
the brain that heighten awareness, affect our
memory and even alleviate pain. Some of these
substances make us feel better and happier,
which enhances the pleasure – so it’s no surprise that many people are keen to continue masturbating and to enjoy more, once they have
discovered the possibilities of masturbation.</p>

<H3>Call it what you like</H3>

<p>The choice of words not only indicates a reaction to or opinion of masturbation. It may
also express a value judgment. Historically,
male masturbation has been more prominent,
and it was more socially acceptable for men to
seek sexual pleasure, masturbation included,
and to talk about "masturbate". Many men
report shared masturbation experiences with
their buddies, and the act is not necessarily
taboo. However, similar tales from women are
very rare, although women too of course have
shared masturbation experiences.</p>
<p>Boys and men talk about experiencies from
wanking or jerking off together, but there
are still no such stories from women about
female masturbation. This is probably because
women’s sexuality has traditionally been more
of a taboo subject than men’s, masturbation
included. But there is, in fact, a wealth of
imaginative words in use out there.</p>

<H1>How to "masturbate"</H1>

<p>People almost always use their hands and fingers to masturbate, because they’re easy to control and can reach more or less all parts of the
body. They can be used for gentle touching and more powerful stimulation, and they can
hold the various objects that some people use
to masturbate. Like the mouth, genitals, nipples and anus, the hands and fingers contain a
large number of nerves, so touching can be
highly pleasurable.The most common way to masturbate is probably to stimulate the glans of the clitoris or
penis, which contains more nerve endings
than any other part of the body. When we’re
sexually aroused, the erectile tissue in the labia, clitoris and penis fills with blood, further
increasing sensitivity. If you want to physically feel your own arousal, place your hand on the
glans or around the shaft of your clitoris or penis, or on your labia, before you become aroused and then feel the erectile tissue engorging.
Lubrication, a transparent, oily fluid, is released through the vaginal walls. Arousal can be
a gradual process or an instantaneous physical
reaction. It can also disappear in seconds if something feels amiss. There are no differences
between women and men in terms of physical
sexual response and their capacity to enjoy it.</p>

<H4>"Masturbate",Massaging, kneading, rubbing</H4>
<p>Some people like to do the same thing every
time they masturbate, while others alternate
between a few favourites or try many different techniques. You can massage, knead, rub,
press, prod, roll, slap or squeeze the various
parts of the genitals. Which technique feels
the most pleasurable at any particular moment
varies, depending on how highly aroused you
are. By varying the pressure and speed, you can
change the sensation. Fondling also feels different depending on which parts of your hands
and fingers you use and the direction of the
strokes. Gentle fondling using several fingers may feel right at one moment, while faster,
more intensive touching with one finger or the
whole hand may produce greater pleasure the
next moment, or on another occasion. Many
people, both men and women, like to use some
sort of extra lubrication while masturbating.
You can buy water- and silicone-based lubricants, or you can use your own saliva, unperfumed baby oil, cooking oil or olive oil.</p>
